BANK LOAN ANALYSIS

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover insights related to loan performance, customer behavior, and risk patterns. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, covering the complete data analytics workflow—from raw data ingestion to dashboard development and presentation of insights. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and business reporting.

DATASET
Source: CSV dataset from Kaggle
Rows: 38,576
Columns: 24
Description: The dataset contains customer demographics, loan details, and repayment information used to evaluate loan trends, defaults, and overall portfolio performance.

TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
Power BI – Data modeling, EDA, and dashboard development
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
Gamma – Creating a professional presentation (PPT)
CSV File – Raw data source
